# How to Host and Format a Resume using Markdown
This Readme will describe how to host and format a resume using _Markdown_ using the techniques described in Andrew Etters' book, _Modern Technical Writing_.

In short, technical writing isn't so much about the writing, as it is about the content. When doing technical writing it's important to understand what we are trying to convey, so we can do so in a succinct and easy to understand manner. 

## Markdown
First things first; it's important to know how to use Markdown before actually writing anything using it. Don't worry, Markdown is extremely simple, and you can learn all the basics in 5-10 mins. I recommend using an online tutorial like [this one.](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). 

Once you have the basics down, you can use any markdown editor to visualize your work (and make sure you're doing everything correctly). There are many editors out there, as well as extentions you can get for popular code editors such as Visual Studio Code, but [here's](https://stackedit.io/) a great one you can use right in your browser.
